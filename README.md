Numerical calculus assignment 1

# Purpose
This assignment's purpose is to apply concepts taught in class through programming exercises while being cautious of the precision.  Including converting binary numbers to decimal, chopping numbers, rounding numbers, computing absolute and relative error, finding minimum terms needed to compute a value with a specified error with an infinite series, and determining how many iterations needed to solve a polynomial using the bisection method and newton raphson method
